% Since the advent of photography practioners have been searching for processed to maximize the detail their images contain.  The photography image is inherneitly a limited representation of our reality.  The discrete nature and the limited technical range condent the visual relationships of our world. Each image sacrifices certain elements to produce a generalized view of the photographers eye.  Photography in it's earliest form was a practive in capturng brightness values.  It's invention in the 1800's as a Black and White medium was our first semi-permanent (all chemical based and ink based photographs fade over time) mechinacal/chemical process to capture our visual existance. Overfitting is a major issue with a limited dataset.  The best CNN models come from big data.  The more images available the better the ability of the model to form a more generalized view of the relationships in the data.  Image issues: Limited size, lighting, exposure, viewpoint, occlusion, background, scale, \dots My Thesis will focus on lighting and exposure issues. Maximize the information in the dataset by creating a more generalized representation by training on the full dynamic range of the image.  
% Overfitting 
When creating nueral networks the size of the dataset directly impacts the ability of the network to learn generalized patterns.  A limited dataset in both size and breath breeds overfitting in the model.  Overfitting is the neural network learning too specificly to the traninging data and not general enough for the range of test data.  Data Augmentation is used to create new training data from a limited dataset.  Classical techniques such as flipping, rotating, translating, and transformeing the color channels are examples of ways the data can be augmented while keeping true to their categorical label.  In this paper I propose a technique with the use of blending modes to highlight features within the dynamic range of the color information.  The Multiply and Screen blending modes are used to focus the data on the shadows (dark areas) and highlights (light areas) respectivily.  The augmented data is fed into the neural network to create a generalized model which better learns the feature space within the limited dynamic range of the augmented images.  Finally the unaugmented data is fed into the network to finely tune the model.  Results to follow...
